    • If so, what are they and how is yours different?

    • Which user group/stakeholders is your application targeting?

        Do not use data without any information provided.
        Do not use text-preprocessed clean data. What is data format: csv, json
    
    • Provide initial data description: 
          • Besides a text field, what other information do you have
              (for example, review data -> location, stars, users; twitter data -> user, likes;...)
      
          •	do you have labeled data?
