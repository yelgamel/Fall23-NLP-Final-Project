### 1.	Project Title: ........

### 2.	Team Names: Group 5 - Carl Cruzan, Maciel Lopez, and Yasmin Elgamel

### 3.	Project Description


#### •	Objectives: 

State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you solve etc?

#### •	Usefulness: 

State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.

Make sure to answer the following questions:

    • Are there any similar or equivalent applications out here? 

    • If so, what are they and how is yours different?

    • Which user group/stakeholders is your application targeting?



#### •	Data:

    • Describe dataset origin (who collected, when, and for what purpose):
        Do not use data without any information provided.
        Do not use text-preprocessed clean data. What is data format: csv, json
    
    • Provide initial data description: 
          • Besides a text field, what other information do you have
              (for example, review data -> location, stars, users; twitter data -> user, likes;...)
      
          •	do you have labeled data?
      
          •	#records, #fields (columns if available), #NA values
        
          •	What type of cleaning does it require?
      
#### •	Functionalities:

Describe tentatively what tasks your application will perform. There are two types of functions you would need to offer:

        • NLP Functions: specific to your NLP tasks
      
        • User Interaction: For example, allowing users to select/filter/search 
      
      
#### •	Communication and Sharing:


        • Communication method: Teams, Canvas, Piazza
      
        • Github repository link for the project: https://github.com/yelgamel/Fall23-NLP-Final-Project
      
        • upload dataset (I WILL DELETE THIS LINE ONCE THE DATA IS UPLOADED)

### 10/13/2023: Note from Yasmin Elgamel:
- Today I created 2 folders on Github: Final Project folder and Testing Phase folder.
- In the Testing Phase folder I created the following as a reference for the Final Project: SentimentAnalyzerWebApp.py, index.html, and result.html
- The app clean, tokenize, lemmatize, and find the polarity of the text entered by the user.
- To try the Flask app in the Testing Phase folder:
    1- From the Testing Phase folder, download index.html and result.html and put them in a folder called "templates". 
    2- Download TestingSentimentAnalyzerWebApp.py. 
    3- Make sure the "templates" folder, and .py file saved in the same area. 
    4- Run the .py file.
